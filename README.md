# LucidApp

LucidApp is a Sinatra-based application that allows users to create and maintain their own dream journal. LucidApp incorporates full CRUD actions, allowing users to create their own journal entries, read theirs and other users' entries, update the entries they've created, and delete any and all entries created on their account. 

## Installation

To use the LucidApp, a user must first install the application on their local machine by forking and cloning this repo. From their a user should follow these steps:

- Execute `$bundle` to install gems
- Execute `$shotgun` to start the server 
- Navigate to `http://localhost:9393/`

Finally, begin journaling your dreams, become more introspective, and sleep better!

## Usage

LucidApp was created to make logging dreams seamless. My hope is that users may gain insight from their dream journals to ultimately lead to a better nights sleep.
